        <p>I ran into several problems making these pages.<br>
            Most of them were styling and making everything line up like how I wanted.<br>
            Once I was able to get my columns lined up correctly, everything looked better.<br>
            It eventually got easier for me to wrap my mind around what I was doing in relation to how the page would look.<br>
            I still don't feel entirely confident working with grids, but I think I have a much better basic understanding of it now.<br>
